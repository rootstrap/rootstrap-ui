# Breakpoints

Breakpoints are used to apply CSS props to the content depending on the device width/height.

**Rootstrap UI** defines all of these breakpoints with SCSS variables.

## Screen breakpoints

Usually breakpoints target different devices to display a responsive content, e.g: desktop, tablet, phone, etc).

| Variable | Value  | Description                          |
| -------- | ------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `$bp-xs` | 0      | Extra small devices                  |
| `$bp-sm` | 576px  | Small devices (phones)               |
| `$bp-md` | 768px  | Medium devices (tablets)             |
| `$bp-lg` | 992px  | Large devices (desktops)             |
| `$bp-xl` | 1200px | Extra large devices (large desktops) |

## Grid breakpoints

Grid System has its own breakpoints. This gives you flexibility to define different breakpoints for the grid and the screens.

Grid breakpoints have the same values as Screen breakpoints by default.

| Variable      | Value    | Description                          |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `$bp-grid-xs` | `$bp-xs` | Extra small devices                  |
| `$bp-grid-sm` | `$bp-sm` | Small devices (phones)               |
| `$bp-grid-md` | `$bp-md` | Medium devices (tablets)             |
| `$bp-grid-lg` | `$bp-lg` | Large devices (desktops)             |
| `$bp-grid-xl` | `$bp-xl` | Extra large devices (large desktops) |

## Mixins

CSS Media query is a technique to take advantage of these breakpoints. **Rootstrap UI** provides mixins to simplify the media queries for the different breakpoints.

## Example

```scss
// Example: Hide starting at \`min-width: 0\`, and then show at the \`sm\` breakpoint
.custom-class {
  display: none;
}
@include media-breakpoint-up(sm) {
  .custom-class {
    display: block;
  }
}
```

## Customize breakpoints

In order to change a breakpoint value, assign a new value to the variable name before importing **Rootstrap UI**'s styles.
